# My Racing Simulator in Java OOP 🏎️

Aims to store my racing simulator project for the second semester subject of my systems analysis and development course at UCSAL

# Statement for Practical Work 📓

The program must simulate the race between two vehicles. 

Each vehicle has a speed and distance that are equal to zero at the start of the race.

At each simulation step, a new speed must be drawn (which can be 1, 2 or 3) and a new distance calculated by adding the speed value.

The distance corresponds to the distance between the start and the vehicle, being represented on the screen as white spaces.

In other words, the distance is the number of blank spaces that must appear on the screen before the character that represents the vehicle.

The vehicle that reaches or exceeds the maximum distance established for the race wins. 

> If both vehicles exceed the maximum distance, the one with the greater distance wins. 

> If the distances at the end are equal then it is a draw.
